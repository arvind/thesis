% Reactive Vega demonstrates that the advantages of declarative specification
% extend to interaction design as well\,---\,decoupling specification from
% execution frees designers to iterate more quickly, facilitates retargeting
% across platforms, and allows for language-level optimizations.

Reactive Vega demonstrates that declarative interaction design is an expressive
and performant alternative to imperative event handling callbacks. However, as
its abstractions are relatively low-level, it would be apt to describe it as an
``assembly language'' for interactive visualization most suited for
\emph{explanatory} visualization. In contrast, for \emph{exploratory}
visualization, higher-level grammars such as ggplot2~\cite{wickham:layered}, and
grammar-based systems such as Tableau (n\'ee Polaris~\cite{stolte:polaris}), are
typically preferred as they favor conciseness over expressiveness. Analysts
rapidly author partial specifications of visualizations; the grammar applies
default values to resolve ambiguities, and synthesizes low-level details to
produce visualizations.

High-level languages can also enable search and inference over the space of
visualizations. For example, Wongsuphasawat et~al. introduced Vega-Lite to power
the Voyager visualization browser~\cite{voyager}. By providing a smaller surface
area than Vega, Vega-Lite makes systematic enumeration and ranking of data
transformations and visual encodings more tractable.

However, existing high-level languages provide limited support for
interactivity. An analyst can, at most, enable a predefined set of common
techniques (linked selections, panning \& zooming, etc.) or parameterize their
visualization with dynamic query widgets~\cite{shiny}. For custom,
direct manipulation interaction they must, once again, turn to imperative event
handling callbacks.

In this chapter, we extend Vega-Lite with a \emph{multi-view} grammar of
graphics alongside a novel \emph{grammar of interaction} to enable concise,
high-level specification of interactive data visualizations.
