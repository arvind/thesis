\chapter{Declarative Primitives for Interaction Design}
\label{sec:vg:lang}

Reactive Vega builds on a long-running thread of research on declarative
visualization design, popularized by the Grammar of
Graphics~\cite{wilkinson:grammar} and Polaris~\cite{stolte:polaris} (now
Tableau).

Visual encodings are defined by composing graphical primitives called
\emph{marks}~\cite{bostock:protovis}, which include \emph{arcs}, \emph{areas},
\emph{bars}, \emph{lines}, plotting \emph{symbols} and \emph{text}. Marks are
associated with datasets, and their specifications map tuple values to visual
properties such as position and color. Scales and guides (i.e., axes and
legends) are provided as first-class primitives for mapping a domain of data
values to a range of visual properties. Special \emph{group} marks serve as
containers to express nested or small multiple displays. Child marks and scales
can inherit a group's data, or draw from independent datasets.

Although interaction is a crucial component of effective
visualization~\cite{liu:mentalmodels, pike:interactionscience}, existing
declarative visualization models, including widely used tools such as
D3~\cite{bostock:d3} and ggplot2~\cite{wickham:ggplot2}, do not offer composable
primitives for interaction design. Instead, if they support interaction, they do
so through either a palette of standard techniques~\cite{bostock:protovis,
bostock:d3} or \emph{imperative} event handling callbacks. While the former
restricts expressivity, the later undoes many of the benefits of declarative
design. In particular, users are forced to contend with interaction execution
details, such as interleaved events and coordinating external state, which can
be complex and error\--prone~\cite{cooper:embedding, edwards:coherent,
myers:callbacks}.

  this case rectangles) are determined by scale mappings. Guides (here, axes)
  can be instantiated as well.}

In response, Reactive Vega introduces a model for \emph{declarative} interaction
design.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:vg:lang-summary}

In this chapter, we demonstrate that the advantages of declarative specification
extend to interaction design as well. With event streams and signals, users need
only describe the relationship between input events and interactive state
respectively. Reactive semantics ensure that this state no longer needs to be
manually maintained by users, but is automatically updated when new events
occur. Moreover, signals provide a powerful abstraction barrier that simplifies
retargeting and has spurred development of a new ``time-traveling''
debugger~\cite{hoffswell:debugging}. Reusing and repurposing interactive
behaviors is also supported by passing predicates through scale inversions, and
extracting declarative specifications to standalone interactors.
