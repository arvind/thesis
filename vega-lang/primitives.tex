\section{Interaction Language Design}
\label{sec:vg:primitives}

\vspace{-10pt}

Reactive Vega models low-level events as composable data streams from which
higher-level semantic \emph{signals} can be constructed. Signals feed
\emph{predicates} and \emph{scale inversions}, to generalize interactive
selections at the level of item geometry (pixels) into interactive queries over
the data domain. \emph{Production rules} then use these queries to manipulate
the visualization's appearance. To facilitate reuse and sharing, these
constructs can be encapsulated as named \emph{interactors}: standalone, purely
declarative specifications of interaction techniques.

\subsection{Event Streams and Signals}
\label{sec:vg:events}

\vspace{-10pt}

Reactive Vega adapts the semantics of Event-Driven Functional Reactive
Programming~\cite{wan:efrp}. Low-level input events (e.g., mouse events) are
captured as time-varying \emph{data streams}, rather than event callbacks. This
abstraction reduces the burden of composing and sequencing
events\,---\,operations that would require several callbacks and some external
state under an imperative paradigm. To this end, we introduce a syntax for
specifying event streams (\cref{fig:vg:eventStreams}). While prior work has
formulated regex-based symbols for event selection~\cite{kin:proton++} we
believe our approach, by mimicking CSS selectors, will be more familiar to
designers.

\begin{figure}[b!]

  \caption{Reactive Vega provides an event stream selector syntax, inspired by
  CSS selectors, to compose, filter, and sequence input events.}
  \label{fig:vg:eventStreams}
\end{figure}

A basic event stream selector is specified by a particular event type (e.g.,
\texttt{mousemove}), optionally prepended with the source of the
events\,---\,either a mark type (e.g., \texttt{rect:}) or name (e.g.,
\texttt{@cell:}). The comma operator (\texttt{,}) merges streams to produce a
single stream with interleaved events. Square brackets (\texttt{[]}) filter
events based on their properties. When followed by the right-combinator
(\texttt{>}), the brackets indicate a ``between filter,'' defining bounding
events for the stream. For instance, \texttt{[mousedown, mouseup] > mousemove}
captures \texttt{mousemove} events that occur between a \texttt{mousedown} and
\texttt{mouseup} (i.e., ``drag'' events). To throttle or debounce an event
stream, timing information can be specified between curly braces (e.g.,
\texttt{\{100, 200\}} throttles a stream by 100ms and debounces it by 200ms).
All operators are composable. For instance, \texttt{[mousedown[event.shiftKey],
window:mouseup] > window:mousemove\{100, 200\}} specifies a stream of throttled
and debounced drag events that are only triggered when the shift key is pressed.

With Reactive Vega, interaction events are a first-class data source. They can
be run through the full gamut of data transformations and can drive visual
encoding primitives. While doing so can usefully visualize a user's interaction,
for added expressivity, event streams can also be composed into reactive
expressions called \emph{signals}. By default, signals are evaluated using the
most recent event from a stream. However, signals can also define finite-state
machines by drawing from multiple streams\,---\,each stream triggers a state
transition.

Signals can be used to directly specify visual encoding primitives (e.g., a
mark's fill color) thereby endowing them with reactive semantics. When an event
fires, it enters appropriate streams and is propagated to corresponding signals;
signals are re-evaluated and dependent visual encodings re-rendered
automatically.

Upon definition, signals must be given unique names. These named entities are
then used to define the rest of an interaction technique, thereby decoupling
input events from downstream application logic. Thus, an interaction can be
triggered by a different set of events by simply rebinding signal declarations.
As we later demonstrate, rebinding is particularly useful for retargeting
interactions or for combining otherwise conflicting interactions.

\subsection{Predicates and Scale Inversion}

\vspace{-10pt}

Selection is a fundamental operation in interactive visualization design~
\cite{heer:generalized}. Once a selection is made, subsequent operators can be
applied to manipulate the selected items. For visual design, it can be
sufficient to make a predetermined selection (e.g., ``select all rectangles'').
With interaction design, however, selections are driven by user
input\,---\,brushing over points of interest, or adjusting a slider to filter
data.

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{predicates}
  \caption{Points are highlighted using (left) an intensional predicate
  \texttt{50 $\leq$ Horsepower $\leq$ 100} or (right) an extensional predicate
  with members \texttt{\#56, \#110, \#79, \#95, \#40, \#120, ...}.}
  \label{fig:vg:predicates}
\end{figure}

To express interactive selections, we introduce reactive \emph{predicates}. As
shown in \cref{fig:vg:predicates}, predicates can be constructed either with an
\emph{intensional} definition\,---\,specifying conditions over properties of
selected members\,---\,or an \emph{extensional} one\,---\,explicitly enumerating
all members of a selection.

Predicate operands are typically signals and, as signals drawn from input event
streams, predicates express interactive selections at the visual (or pixel)
level by default. However, pixel-level selection is often insufficient. A single
visualization may have multiple distinct visual spaces, or an interactive
technique may wish to coordinate several visualizations. In such cases, it is
necessary to generalize an interactive selection into a query over the data
domain~\cite{heer:generalized}. Scale functions are a critical component in
visualization design~ \cite{wilkinson:grammar} as they transform data values
into visual values such as pixels or colors. By applying an \emph{inverted}
scale function to predicate operands, we can lift a predicate to the data
domain. \Cref{fig:vg:scaleInversion} demonstrates how a predicate defines an
interactive selection and, when coupled with scale inversions, an interactive
query to drive an overview\,+\,detail visualization.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{scaleInversion}
  \caption{\emph{Predicates} use signal values to define interactive selections
of elements. Using \emph{scale inversions}, predicates can be generalized to
define interactive queries, and thus operate across different coordinate spaces:
overview (bottom) and detail (top).}
  \label{fig:vg:scaleInversion}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Production Rules}

\vspace{-10pt}

Production rules are an established design pattern for visualization
specification~\cite{heer:designpatterns} that we endow with reactive semantics.
A rule defines the outcome of evaluating an \texttt{if-then-else} chain to set
property values. For example, a rule might set a mark's fill color using
scale-transformed data if predicate \texttt{A} is true, set it to yellow is
predicate \texttt{B} is true, or otherwise set the color to grey by default.

\vspace{-10pt}

\subsection{User-Defined Functions}
\label{sec:udfs}

\vspace{-10pt}

During our design process, we encountered visualizations in which interactions
trigger custom data transforms. For example, sorting a co-occurrence matrix by
frequency or querying time-series data via relaxed
selections~\cite{holz:relaxed}. It is not feasible for a declarative language to
natively support all possible functions, yet custom operations must still be
expressible. Following the precedent of languages such as SQL, we provide
\emph{user-defined functions}. Such functions must be defined and registered
with the system at runtime, and can subsequently be invoked declaratively within
the specification. User-defined functions ensure that the language remains
concise and domain-specific, while ensuring extensibility to idiosyncratic
operations.

\vspace{-10pt}

\subsection{Encapsulated Interactors}

\vspace{-10pt}

To enable reuse of custom interaction techniques, Reactive Vega's interaction
primitives can be parameterized and encapsulated as named \emph{interactors}.
Inspired by Garnet's component of the same name~\cite{myers:garnet}, a Reactive
Vega's interactor can subsequently be applied to a visualization and functions
as a mixin. Its specification is merged into the host's and, to prevent
conflicts, its components are addressable only under its namespace.
\Cref{fig:vg:splomInteractor,fig:vg:brush} illustrate how a brushing
interaction (within a single scatterplot) can be extracted to a standalone
interactor, and reapplied to brush \& link a scatterplot matrix.
