Reactive Vega and Vega-Lite offer JSON syntaxes to facilitate programmatic
generation of interactive visualizations within higher-level interactive
applications. In this chapter, I explore this nascent space with Lyra: an
interactive visualization design environment (VDE). Lyra is motivated by
recognizing that Reactive Vega and Vega-Lite present a fundamental mismatch in
representations\,---\,using \emph{textual} languages to express \emph{visual}
output. As a result, with a commensurately poor ``closeness of
mapping,''~\cite{blackwell:cogdim} these languages impose a wide gulf of
execution~\cite{hutchins:directmanip}. It can be difficult for users to map
desired graphical outputs with the required textual specifications.

Existing graphical applications for visualization design, however, have limited
expressivity. At one end are \emph{chart typologies}~\cite{wilkinson:grammar}:
pre-defined palettes of chart types (bar charts, line charts, etc.) that make
numerous design decisions on behalf of the user. At the other end, vector
graphics packages offer designers complete flexibility but provide few (if any)
data-driven abstractions~\cite{bigelow:reflections}.
