Data visualization has gone mainstream. From business intelligence to data
journalism, society has embraced visualization as a medium for recording,
analyzing, and communicating about data. This explosion of use is reflected in
the proliferation of visualization tools, which span the gamut of expressivity.
At one end are chart templates (e.g., Google Fusion Tables, or as found in
spreadsheet packages such as Microsoft Excel). Users can easily generate
recognizable output by choosing from a pre-defined palette of chart types, but
only a handful of properties may be customized. At the other end are vector
graphics programs (e.g., Adobe Illustrator), and low-level programming APIs
(e.g., Processing or OpenGL). Users have complete control but the added
expressivity trades-off ease-of-use.

Advances in visualization toolkits have popularized \emph{grammar-based}
approaches for visual encodings
\cite{wilkinson:grammar,stolte:polaris,wickham:layered,bostock:protovis,bostock:d3}.
These models are more expressive than chart templates as they decompose the
design space into combinatorial primitives for data transformation and visual
encoding. Moreover, they embody \emph{declarative design}\,---\,the languages
describe \emph{what} the visualization should look like, rather than \emph{how}
it should be rendered. As a result, users are free to focus on visual encoding
and design decisions while the underlying runtime is entirely responsible for
execution concerns and performance optimization~\cite{heer:protovisjava}.

However, key challenges remain. Interaction is critical for effective
visualization, allowing users to interrogate data and iteratively refine their
mental models~\cite{pike:interactionscience,yi:understanding}. Yet, existing
declarative visualization models provide poor support for interaction
techniques. Simple ``interaction typologies'' (e.g., brushing, panning, etc.)
are available, but limit customization. Thus, users often author
\emph{imperative} event handling callbacks that undo the benefits of declarative
design. Users are forced to manually maintain state~\cite{cooper:embedding} and
coordinate interleaved execution\,---\,a complex and error-prone task
colloquially called ``callback hell''~\cite{edwards:coherent}.

Moreover, most existing declarative models (including
ggplot2~\cite{wickham:layered} and D3~\cite{bostock:d3}) are instantiated via
complex APIs embedded in programming languages. This approach imposes a
non-trivial \emph{articulatory distance}~\cite{hutchins:directmanip} as users
must map their desired \emph{visual} output to \emph{textual} commands\,---\,a
fundamental mismatch in representations.

\section{Thesis Contributions and Outline}

This dissertation is divided into seven chapters, and contributes a layered
stack of new declarative languages for \emph{interactive} visualization as well
as a new interactive system for visualization design through direct
manipulation.

\Cref{sec:related_work} surveys prior work that this dissertation builds on,
including a panoply of visualization toolkits and systems, methods from
functional programming languages and streaming database systems, and generative
models of user interfaces.

\Cref{sec:vg:lang} introduces Reactive Vega: a declarative language for
interactive data visualization that models user interaction as \emph{streaming
data}. Alongside established declarative visual encoding primitives, Reactive
Vega introduces event streams and signals, two constructs from Functional
Reactive Programming. Event streams, defined with a novel CSS-inspired selector
syntax, abstract the complexity of capturing and sequencing input events. Event
streams drive signals: dynamic expressions that are automatically reevaluated
when new events fire. Signals parameterize visual encoding primitives, thereby
endowing them with reactive semantics\,---\,when a new event fires, it is
propagated to corresponding signals; dependent visual encodings are reevaluated
and the visualization is automatically re-rendered. Additional primitives allow
interaction techniques to be generalized and reused across distinct
visualizations. This chapter demonstrates Reactive Vega's expressivity through
example visualizations that cover an established interaction taxonomy.

\Cref{sec:vg:arch} studies the implications of declarative interaction design on
the architecture of visualization systems. The Reactive Vega architecture adapts
and extends techniques from streaming database systems. In particular, an input
declarative specification (expressed as JavaScript Object Notation) is parsed to
construct a dataflow graph. Dataflow operators perform computations on
\emph{changesets} of tuples or scene graph elements, and are \emph{replayed} if
signal parameter values change. To support data-driven multi-view displays, the
dataflow graph is conditioned on data values. As new tuples are observed, or as
interaction events occur, the graph \emph{dynamically rewrites itself} at
runtime by extending or pruning branches. Performance optimizations are
described and comparative benchmark studies conducted to evaluate Reactive
Vega's performance. These studies find that Reactive Vega meets or exceeds the
performance of D3~\cite{bostock:d3} and the prior Vega system.

\Cref{sec:vega-lite} introduces Vega-Lite: a higher-level grammar that builds on
Reactive Vega. Vega-Lite extends a traditional grammar of graphics with a
\emph{view composition algebra} for layered and multi-view displays. A novel
\emph{grammar of interaction} features \emph{selections}: an abstraction that
encapsulates input event processing, points of interest, and a predicate
function for inclusion testing. Selections parameterize visual encodings by
serving as input data, defining scale extents, or by driving conditional logic.
Vega-Lite specifications are concise through ambiguity: lower-level details
(e.g., the events that trigger a selection) can be omitted and are filled in by
the Vega-Lite compiler. The smaller language surface area also facilitates
higher-level reasoning tasks, such as systematic enumeration of alternative
designs. These language properties are reified by recreating the examples from
\Cref{sec:vg:lang}.

\Cref{sec:lyra} introduces Lyra: an interactive environment that leverages both
Reactive Vega and Vega-Lite for visualization design by direct manipulation.
Through drag-and-drop interactions, users bind data values to mark properties.
Data transformations and layout algorithms are visually specified and inspected
with a ``data pipeline'' interface. As a higher-level graphical interface, Lyra
allows users to fluidly move between the different levels of abstraction. Direct
manipulation interactions generate statements in Vega-Lite, which are compiled,
and merged into a backing Reactive Vega specification; the visual inspectors
provide complete control over the latter. Thus, users can iterate between
rapidly creating recognizable output and making fine-grained
customizations\,---\,an approach that yields a diverse range of visualizations
without writing a single line of code.

Finally, \Cref{sec:conclusion} sketches new research directions that Reactive
Vega and Vega-Lite enable. These systems have been released as open-source
projects, and have already been used to power the Voyager visualization
recommendation browser~\cite{voyager,voyager2,compassql}, develop a model for
sequencing visualizations~\cite{kim:graphscape}, and reverse-engineer
visualizations from chart images~\cite{poco:reverse}. Moreover, the broader
adoption both tools have seen\,---\,Vega is used to embed interactive
visualizations within Wikipedia articles, and Vega-Lite can be used within
Jupyter notebooks\,---\,provide a growing, engaged user community to study their
use with.
